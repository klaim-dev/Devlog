## ðŸ“… Day 4 â€” Ownership in Rust (Move, Copy, Clone)

### ðŸ§  Focus
Todayâ€™s focus was on one of Rustâ€™s core concepts â€” **Ownership**.  
We explored how values move, when they get copied, and how to manage memory safely **without cloning**.

### âœ… What We Covered

| Concept     | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `move`      | âœ…     | Ownership transfer for `String` and other heap data |
| `copy`      | âœ…     | `i32`, `bool`, and other `Copy` types stay usable after assignment |
| `clone()`   | âœ…     | Deep copy of heap data â€” used explicitly only when needed |
| `&str` vs `String` | âœ… | Used `.as_str()` to compare owned strings with literals safely |

---

### ðŸ§ª Mini Tasks Completed

- Moved and cloned `String` values properly
- Fixed borrow-checker violations with mutable/immutable references
- Differentiated between move and copy types in practice
- Explained what happens in memory (stack/heap) during assignments
