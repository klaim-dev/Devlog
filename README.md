# klaim — 7 months to rebuild

I’m 28.  
I’ve never written code.

Today, I begin a path — from absolute zero to blockchain engineer.

I cut my life down to $1.5k/month.  
I saved just enough for 7 months.  
That’s all I’ve got.

A roof.  
An old PC.  
ChatGPT.  
And silence.

## 💡 Why?

I don’t just want to *learn* Rust and Solana.  
I want to understand. Like an engineer.  
To break things down. Bit by bit.  
To build real knowledge — from fundamentals to production.

## 🧱 What’s in this repo?

This is my daily DevLog.

Every day:
- 📂 A folder (`01_day`, 02_day, …)
- ✍️ A challenge of the day (from syntax to architecture)
- 💥 Mistakes, thoughts, breakthroughs
- 📄 README: what I built, what I learned

This isn’t a tutorial.  
This is 7 months of rebuilding myself.

## 🛠️ The learning path (compressed)

1. Rust Core — memory, ownership, structs (30 days)  
2. Rust Backend — Axum, PostgreSQL, architecture, CI/CD (40 days)  
3. Advanced Rust — lifetimes, async, complex patterns (50 days)  
4. Solana — Anchor, smart contracts, blockchain security (60–75 days)
