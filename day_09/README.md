## ðŸ“… Rust Day 9 â€” Structs, impl & Methods

### ðŸ“Œ Theme of the Day
Today I'm  focused on **structs**, how to implement them using `impl`, and how to build logic through **methods** using:
- `&self`, `&mut self`, and `self`
- Struct initialization and field access
- Composition of logic using multiple methods per type
- Encapsulation of behavior inside domain-specific types

---

### âœ… Key Concepts Covered

- Defining `struct` with fields
- Implementing methods with `impl`
- Using ownership and borrowing (`&mut`, `&`)
- Calling methods from `main()`
- Returning `Result<T, E>` from methods
- Working with `Option<T>` in fields
