## ðŸ§  Rust Dev Log â€” Day 2: Arithmetic, Booleans, and Conditional Logic

### ðŸ“… Topic:
- Integer and float types: `i32`, `f64`
- Boolean logic: `bool`
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Conditional branching: `if`, `else`, and nested conditions
- Using `if` as an expression

---

### âœ… What I did today:
- Practiced arithmetic and comparison operations in Rust
- Explored how `if` is an **expression**, not just a control-flow construct
- Learned to write multi-branch logic using nested `if`/`else`
- Built several logic-based systems with increasing complexity
- Focused on reasoning through **priorities**, **branch ordering**, and **early exit logic**

### ðŸ”¬ Key Concepts:

#### ðŸ§® Arithmetic

let a = 10;
let b = 3;
let sum = a + b;
let remainder = a % b;
