ðŸ“˜ DevLog â€” Day 10: Struct + Result + match

ðŸ”§ Topics Covered:

* struct and impl

* Return values via Result

* Ownership and mutability

* Searching and updating with .iter_mut(), .find()

* Tracking global state with self.next_id

ðŸ§  What I Learned
* How to design systems with multiple related structs (User, Task, TaskManager)

* How to build APIs for business logic using Rust's Result and Option

* How to protect system logic with error messages and safe condition checks

* How to think like a backend developer: inputs, side-effects, error handling, state mutation

ðŸ§± Architecture Level
âœ… Fully modular
âœ… Memory-safe
âœ… Logic-first, not just syntax
âœ… Clear data ownership and flow

This is a real simulation of task management systems used in SaaS, CRM, and productivity tools.
