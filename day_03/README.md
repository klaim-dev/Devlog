ðŸ“ˆ Day 3 DevLog Summary

âœ… Topics Covered
* fn, return, tuple return values

* Clean signature design and parameter control

* Conditional branching inside functions

* Destructuring and using tuple return values

* Writing backend-ready functional code

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
* How to build logical flows inside functions

* How to return multiple values cleanly

* How to apply conditional decision trees realistically

* Why f64, u32, and &str require precise coordination

ðŸ”¥ Challenge Completed
* Built a full shipping logic function with:

* Rejection paths

* Discount logic

* Pricing strategy

* Strong typing and readable output

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
This day solidified my understanding of function-based logic, real-world use of tuple returns, and how to design flow that mirrors backend logic.
